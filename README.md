Repository for evaluation of VAST package for single and multispecies spatial delta-generalized linear mixed models (delta-GLMM). The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate differences in indices and uncertainty estimates generated by VAST and design-based estimators, for a range of species in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.
