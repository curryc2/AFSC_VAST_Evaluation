# Test_Obs_Model
#### R Script: Test-Obs-Model.r

***

Evaluation of differences in [VAST](https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST) model results for example species, with different observation models.
Distribution for positive catch rate will be evaluated.
Rational for analysis was poor observed Q-Q and Pearson residual plots for positive catch rate component in some species. 

*	Note: Wrapper functions rely on calls to existing functions developed by J. Thorson [VAST](https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST)
