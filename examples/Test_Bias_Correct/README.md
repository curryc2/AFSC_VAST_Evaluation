# Test_Bias_Correct
#### R Script: Test-Bias-Correct.r

***
Compares bias effect of bias correction [VAST](https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST) model-based index values.
***

1.  Use baseline knot numbers = 100, 500. 
2.  Loop over bias correct TRUE/FALSE
2.  Loop over knot numbers
3.  Loop over species
4.  Build [VAST](https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST) model with and run.
4.  Loop through and delete unnecessary folder structure, while building overall list object.
5.  Saves index values and uncertainty, optimization results for retreiving AIC, and Report object.

*	Note: Wrapper functions rely on calls to existing functions developed by J. Thorson [VAST](https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST)
