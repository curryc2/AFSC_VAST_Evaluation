# Test-Parallel.r
Example of how to create wrapper function to run VAST models in parallel across species and surveys. 
* Currently, I post-hoc remove Save.RData files to save space.

***

*	Note: Wrapper functions rely on calls to existing functions developed by J. Thorson [VAST](https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST)
